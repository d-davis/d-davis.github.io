<h2>Brief Biography</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am an archaeologist specializing in remote sensing applications and human-environmental interaction. I focus primarily on population settlement distributions and their connections to resource use. Central to my research are technologies such as remote sensing and GIS and theoretical frameworks from behavioral ecology, complex adaptive systems, and evolutionary ecology. My research largely focuses on island and coastal regions, and seeks to further our understanding of the long-term impacts of human settlement and livelihood strategies. My doctoral dissertation focuses on establishing linkages between environmental conditions and human settlement patterns in Southwest Madagascar using a variety of paleoclimate proxies and geospatial methods, including a systematic landscape survey of archaeological deposits using remote sensing instruments and machine learning algorithms. I also serve on the Editorial Board of <em>Archaeological Prospection</em>.</p>
