Cumulative environmental change is negatively impacting the sustainability of coastal communities. 
Archaeology provides a deep-time perspective into the impacts of climate change on human 
populations, as our species has coped with varying degrees of environmental change for most of 
our existence. This project seeks to investigate the relationship between settlement choice and 
environmental conditions in coastal foraging populations over the last 4000 years. This project 
will provide important insight into the interlinked social and environmental factors that affect 
settlement choices. By investigating community settlement choice in an area known for its extreme
environmental conditions, we can better understand variability in human responses to 
environmental change. Clarifying the connection between human behavior and environmental 
change is vital, as environmental change impacts on livelihoods are intensifying. In addition 
to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of 
empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the methods proposed here will also assist
communities in conserving their cultural heritage by systematically recording human activities 
on the landscape through time. Three main questions are posed by this project: 1) How important 
are natural resources in human settlement choice? 2) Are major climate events accompanied by 
shifts in the distribution and density of settlements? and 3) Do social factors, such as community 
ties or networks, influence settlement patterns, and if so, to what degree? Using an automated 
remote sensing procedure, this project will systematically record archaeological deposits in this
coastal foraging community and researchers will survey and excavate identified locations to
establish site chronologies. Next, environmental conditions over the past several thousand years
will be reconstructed using fossilized corals. Finally, these data will be incorporated into 
spatial statistical models to analyze the relationship between environmental conditions and 
settlement distributions over time. The project would advance archaeological knowledge about 
human-environment interactions, and the role of mobility in human adaptations to environmental 
change.

We propose to integrate local, Indigenous and descendant (LID) knowledge, automated satellite 
based archaeological remote sensing, and geochemical proxy records from fossil corals to 
reconstruct changes in human settlement distribution, resource use, and paleoclimate/
paleoenvironment in southwest coastal Madagascar over the course of the Holocene. This project 
will generate and analyze large datasets on long-term landscape change and past human response 
that are vital for understanding and successfully tackling critical threats to local livelihoods,
cultural heritage and biological diversity today. Specifically, this project will provide a model, 
accessible and scalable machine learning tools and a common language for researchers, local 
communities and policy makers to reconstruct and understand landscape-level changes over time 
and clarify co-evolutionary relationships between people, climate and environment. Second, this 
project lays a critical foundation for testing theories about the adaptive role and importance 
of human mobility for climate resiliency, in a current policy environment that favors 
sedentarization of rural communities. The proposed multidisciplinary integration of LID knowledge, 
and archaeological and paleoclimate datasets will allow us to connect how people’s interactions 
with their environment and responses to climate change, most often seen at the site level, 
translate into landscape-level phenomena, and lend insights beyond our Madagascar case study.

Clarifying  the  interplay  between  humans,  environment,  and  climate  on Madagascar through 
time has broad implications for an improved understanding of coastal systems world-wide, yet 
over 75% of the island’s 500,000 km2 area remains archaeologically unknown. Traditional 
archaeological approaches have failed to generate data at a large enough spatial scale to 
meaningfully assess how people have shaped the island’s environment and responded to its 
variable climate regimes. We propose to integrate traditional ecological knowledge, automated 
satellite-based archaeological remote sensing, and geochemistry to track anthropogenic landscape 
change in southwest Madagascar over the past several-hundred years. Our proposed research 
addresses the critical  need  to understand how  local  people  in  SW  Madagascar  have  
adapted  their traditional subsistence and landscape management practices over time, including a
high degree of settlement  mobility,  to  mitigate livelihood  risks  in one  of  the  world’s 
most  critically  threatened biodiversity hotspots. Our project will focus on the analysis of 
satellite imagery and ground-truthed archaeological data from the Namonte region of SW 
Madagascar. We aim to use machine learning algorithms to identify sites, features and vegetation 
signatures linked to the migration of cattle pastoralists into the region beginning in the 17th 
century, and will use AMS radiocarbon dating to establish settlement chronologies. The arrival 
of pastoralists in the region has previously been studied from a historical perspective, and 
our project seeks to investigate the extent of likely significant transformations to landscape 
and local ecologies as pastoralists constructed a niche in the region.</div>

Climate change is perhaps one of the greatest threats facing humanity in the 21st century. As such, 
the focus of the environment’s effects on human settlement is of great importance to the modern 
world and helps to advance NASA’s Earth Science Directive. Madagascar is a perfect case study of 
severe environmental change and its effects on humans through time because of its high levels of 
ecological diversity and longstanding history of climate change. Past patterns of human settlement 
can reveal important connections between demographic and environmental change, which in turn 
can prepare society for similar circumstances today. Environmental change is already affecting 
coastal communities on Madagascar and understanding these drivers can assist in developing 
environmental policies and preparing for future demographic shifts. Specifically, this project 
will investigate the socio-environmental mechanisms that influenced settlement strategies on 
Madagascar over the past 3,000 years. The proposed research will demonstrate how researchers 
can combine remote sensing datasets with spatial statistics to iteratively investigate human 
behaviors over time.</div>

Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world(~500,000 km2) and represents an exceptional 
location to address human-environmental interconnectivity, as it contains a widely diverse set of 
environmental conditions which have changed through time. Questions concerning settlement and 
its connection to environmental change are particularly important for the local communities living 
along the coasts of Madagascar. The Vezo people –a Malagasy population whose name roughly 
translated to “people of the sea”–are inseparable from maritime lifeways. Yet, Madagascar’s 
coasts are actively threatened by sea level rise, erosion, and anthropogenic development. By 
systematically investigating the cultural heritage of southwest Vezo communities via remote 
sensing, this study will: 1)improve the ability for scholars and local communities to conserve 
and protect Malagasy history at risk from extractive industry development and climate change; 
and 2) will permit for a landscape scale analysis of settlement and mobility patterns as adaptive

Archaeology can yield important insights that improve modern society. As the world 
faces increased risk from environmental disasters, questions concerning how people 
have successfully coped in similar circumstances elevate insignificance. Sea-level 
rise threatens to displace coastal populations numbering in the hundreds-of-millions 
in the next several decades. As such, studying the effects of climate change on 
human migration patterns can help to prepare the modern world for the consequences 
of similar events. Madagascar represents an exceptional location to address

As the world faces increased risk from environmental disasters, questions concerning 
how past peoples successfully coped with similar dilemmas elevate in significance. In  
Madagascar, climate change impacts have been and will continue to be severe. Thus, there 
is a largely untapped record  of  human  response  to  climate  change  at  risk  of  
disappearance.  To  address  questions concerning mobility and its adaptive utility in
variable environments, a systematic landscape-scale understanding  of  the  archaeological 
record  is  required.  In  this  dissertation,  I  aim  to  address landscape scale mobility
and settlement and its relationship with environmental change in coastal Southwest Madagascar. 
To accomplish this task, I will develop a predictive model using remote sensing data to detect
cultural materials in the Morombe district of Madagascar. Identified deposits will  be  surveyed
using satellite remote  sensing  and  ground-based methods  to  look  at  shifts  in settlement 
patterns since the Late Holocene (~10,000 B.P. –1500 B.P.)and their environmental context. Then, 
I  will  construct  a  multiproxy  marine  paleoclimate  dataset  using  fossil  corals. 
Paleoclimate  records  applied  to  archaeological  data,  to  date,  have  only  utilized  
terrestrial information, but to understand coastal populations, marine data are essential. As 
such, this project will  contribute  to  our  understanding  of  how  coastal  communities

<div id="EESLgrant2" class="collapse">
Establishing definitive chronologies is a longstanding challenge for archaeologists, and this 
is particularly true in the tropics, where high temperatures and humidity degrade materials 
that are useful for radiocarbon (14C) dating. In Madagascar and other tropical landmasses, 
eggshell frequently becomes an important component of the archaeological record. However,
the customary 14C dating of the mineral (calcium carbonate) fraction of eggshell is often 
complicated by the fact that carbon in this fraction can be derived from both contemporary 
atmosphere and relatively “old” (14C-depleted) carbon from bedrock. This problem of 
“old carbon” complicates the interpretation of 14C data from eggshell and associated 
organic material such as charcoal and bone. To address this issue, I am developing a refined 
method of extracting the minor protein fraction present in eggshell for 14C analysis, 
which will improve the reliability and accuracy of eggshell 14C data. The proposed work with 
eggshell from Madagascar will help clarify the island’s human settlement chronology, which is 
poorly resolved yet essential to many of the environmental and political narratives in the 
western Indian Ocean. Despite being the fourth largest island in the world, the earliest 
concrete archaeological evidence for humans on Madagascar dates to about 1350 years before 
present (B.P.). There is some evidence provided from stone tools that humans were present 
on the island as early as 5000 B.P., and recently-described cut marks on endemic animal bone 
suggests a human presence on the island as early as 11000 B.P.Previous eggshell carbonate 
14C work supported by EESL indicates that many eggshells found within archaeological 
contexts are approximately between 1000 and 9000 years old. Robust chronologies that tie 
together archaeological and paleoenvironmental data from Madagascar will allow us to learn 
more about past adaptation to environmental change. Such learning from the past will be 
important as forest clearance and climate change continue to threaten many lifeways in 
Madagascar. The proposed work with eggshell will immediately contribute to our understanding 
of Madagascar’s past and has the potential to strengthen archaeological chronologies on many 
other tropical landmasses. Improving our knowledge about the temporal context of human 
settlements can form the basis of studies on human-environmental interactions in the past, 
which will yield important conclusions for modern day conservation and environmental policies.</div>

Here, we propose the first automated archaeological remote sensing survey of Southwest 
Madagascar with the goal of improving our understanding of past settlement patterns and 
the factors that influence settlement mobility. The human settlement of Madagascar, the 
fourth largest island in the world,remains one of the most hotly contested questions in 
island archaeology. Our ability to answer the question of when and how this large island 
was settled is, however, constrained by the combination of vast stretches of archaeologically
unexplored territory, high costs associated with traditional approaches to archaeological 
survey, and a relatively small contingent of active field  archaeologists. These limitations 
also present an important opportunity to apply remote sensing techniques to the island’s 
archaeological landscapes, in order to expand the inventory of archaeological sites and 
elucidate regional settlement patterns. Remote sensing is  an  important  tool  for  
archaeological  research  as  these approaches offer the ability to systematically evaluate 
archaeological signatures at the landscape scale. The massive datasets generated through 
remote sensing, however,require the development of machine learning algorithms and image 
analysis software to effectively and  systematically study this information and improve  
our  knowledge of the  archaeological record. We  will  use spectral signatures of known 
archaeological  deposits  in Madagascar  to develop  an automated classification method.  
We  will  then  ground-truth  all  identified  locations and determine the accuracy of the 
technique. Subsequently, all confirmed sites will be sampled for the purpose of building a
settlement chronology of  the Velondriake area.  This  research is particularly critical on 
Madagascar given current trends in development and extractive industry (e.g. mining and  
logging)  on  the  island,  as  the  proposed  work will help  to more  quickly identify and 
protect  cultural heritage  that  is at  risk. It will also set the stage for future studies 
attempting to  understand the complex dynamics  between  human  behavior and its influences 
(e.g.,  environmental  change) through  time. More broadly, the creation of a machine learning 
algorithm for use in African and Malagasy archaeology is an innovative contribution,as very few 
studies have been published on automated remote sensing survey for archaeology  in  this part  
of  the  world. Using a similar procedure to the one outlined above, we also propose to 
identify fossil coral beds off the coast of the study area. These fossil corals can be used 
to create a high-resolution paleoclimate record, which will improve our understanding of human-
environmental relationships, specifically with regard to human migration as a response to 
climate change.</div>

On Madagascar, much of the island’s archaeological settlement history is unknown, and little-
to-no research has been conducted applying spaceborne technologies to the investigation of 
human settlement or its environmental context. This leaves our understanding of Madagascar’s 
earliest settlement patchy and largely biased towards areas with more recent historical 
significance. To alleviate this shortcoming, remote sensing –specifically spaceborne satellite 
datasets can be used to locate prehistoric cultural deposits at landscape scales. This type of 
analysis has successfully led to the discovery of hundreds-of-thousands of archaeological sites 
worldwide. In this project, I will develop a remote sensing model situated firmly within 
frameworks stemming from the geosciences and anthropology. I will develop a remote sensing 
algorithm that includes culturally important environmental variables – including coral reefs, 
waterbodies, and vegetative health – in order to identify areas with a high probability of 
containing archaeological materials within the Velondriake region of Southwest Madagascar. 
Culturally important environmental resources listed above will be identified and quantified

Risks posed by climate change are not new, and archaeology can shed light on how humans have 
coped with these stressors in the past, and thereby shed light on potential solutions in the 
present. Madagascar provides a good case study for studying these relationships. To study 
human-environmental  relationships in  Southwestern  Madagascar, two  distinct projects are  
needed  that integrate into a larger study. The first project involves the use of machine 
learning algorithms and remote sensing data to identify the locations of new archaeological
sites in Southwest Madagascar. This will allow for a more complete understanding of settlement
distributions in this part of the island and the history of  human  occupation. The deposits 
identified  by  this  survey  will  be  ground-tested during field visits and all confirmed
archaeological deposits will be sampled for datable materials. This will serve to construct a 
chronological sequence of human settlements of this area through time. The second project will 
center around  the creation  of  a  high-resolution  environmental  proxy  for Southwestern 
Madagascar using fossil corals. During preliminary field visits to Madagascar, I will identify the 
locations of fossil corals –with the help of local divers –that can be cored to produce a climate
record for Southwestern Madagascar over the past several thousand years. The locations of 
potential sites have been suggested by Douglas and Zinke (2015) but must be confirmed by field 
visits. Linking these two projects will involve the use of quantitative modeling to understand 
the correlation  and  causal  relationships  (if  thereare  any)  between environmental conditions  
and changes in settlement patterns through time. Together, this dissertation project will produce
one of the highest-resolution paleoenvironmental  proxies  for  this  part  of  the  world to date
and will undertake  the  first  semiautomatic  remote  sensing  survey for Malagasy archaeology.</div>

The  timing  and  nature  of  human  settlement  in  Madagascar  remains 
among  the  most  contested questions in Island Archaeology. Timings of 
these arrivals range from~ 1500 B.P. to as early as 11,000 B.P. 
Studies thus far indicate that the earliest occupations are in the 
Southwest, and recent archaeological survey work in this region has 
resulted in the identification of several thousand eggshells from elephant 
birds (ratite genera Aepyornis and Mullerornis) with archaeological 
associations.  These  samples can  yield C14 determinations to assist in 
dating  the associated cultural deposits and may yield ages that exceed 
those of other known archaeological sites. As such, this new information 
may push back the date of initial human colonization of the island. 
This study will contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding the history 
of human presence in this region.</div>
